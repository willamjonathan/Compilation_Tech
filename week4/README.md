<h1>Good afternoon sir!</h1>

My name is William Jonathan Mulyadi (2502045683) from L5AC and here is my solution to the assignment 1. <br>
I worked with my friend Alexandro Joe Claudio (2501963160).<br>

<nr>
We made 2 solutions 1 is named calculator-solution2.py (which is our main solution) <br>
The second solution is just an alternate solution, however the multi-line comment is still on progress.<br>

There is also proof of working code to show that the code is working.<br>
