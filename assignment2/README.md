<h1>Good afternoon sir!</h1>

My name is William Jonathan Mulyadi (2502045683) from L5AC and here is my solution to the assignment 2. <br>
I worked with my friend Alexandro Joe Claudio (2501963160).<br>

<br>
The solution that we made is named parser.py  <br>


There is also proof of working code to show that the code is working.<br>
